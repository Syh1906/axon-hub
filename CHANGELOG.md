## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added per-channel API key rules with status/keyword matching, configurable error thresholds, temporary auto-recovery, and permanent disable/delete actions.

## [v1.0.0-beta10-fork.7.syh.8] - 2026-10-31

### Added

- Standard/Fast/Ultrafast pricing with official references, per-item multiplier or unit-price overrides, long-context rules, frozen evidence and consistent budget settlement.
- Full Codex model catalogs, client-aware HTTP/WebSocket transport, and complete multi-turn Responses history recovery.
- Inline group/key editing, dashboard period costs, channel daily usage, project read visibility, incremental request/channel lists and refresh controls.
- New-input token details, mode/context cost badges, whole-row expansion, grouped leaderboard defaults and channel cache-ranking costs.

### Fixed

- Regex and prefix model-price matching, matched output limits for budget admission, zero-price preservation and stale price-editor responses.
- Truncated Responses history, unsafe replay after uncertain sends, terminal service-tier parsing and local budget-error attribution.
- Duplicate usage counts, cache-hit ratios, SQLite day boundaries, group request-log GraphQL evidence, date editing and interrupted operation recovery.

### Release

- GitHub Actions publishes amd64/arm64 GHCR images plus release.json by default; cross-platform binaries are optional via publishBinaries and omitted for this version.
- No new database migration; back up before upgrading from .syh.7. Older binaries do not understand the new pricing rules. See the release notes for verification limits.

## [v1.0.0-beta10-fork.7.syh.7] - 2026-10-30

### Added

- Request log calendar and second-precision filters, combined channel/tag/key/group filtering, and persisted URL selections.
- Per-attempt routing, credential hints, sanitized failure evidence, and actual retry/stop decisions; optional channel website links.
- Project API key groups with bulk operations, resumable receipts, direct group usage, and shared key/group monetary budgets.
- Per-image size-based pricing, official DeepSeek/Moonshot wallet queries, and saved default provider filtering.

### Fixed

- Reporting timezone access for project request readers, stale key hints across credential types, and missing stop reasons after streaming output.
- Account balance refresh coupling with key assignment lookups, multi-currency aggregation, and current-page refresh scope.

### Upgrade

- Ent manages new group, operation receipt and budget tables plus nullable request diagnostics and website fields; no new data migration version.
- Backup format 1.6 preserves budgets and group state; older versions reject the new format. Back up the database and configuration before upgrading.
- See [.syh.7 release notes](https://github.com/Syh1906/axon-hub/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta10-fork.7.syh.7) for migration, rollback and verification limits.
